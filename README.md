# Event-prosthetic-vision
Pipeline for event-based simulated prosthetic vision and Canny Edge detected prosthetic vision for the task of object detection for the CORe50 dataset. 

## Description
This project was part of my Master Thesis "Optimisation of prosthetic vision for the detection of domestic objects using a silicon retina", in which the potential of a silicon retina known as Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) as a front-end sensor for prosthetic vision was explored. For this purpose, a pipeline for event-based prosthetic vision was created and tested using a Tensorflow object detection model (EfficientDet-D0) using the CORe50 dataset. For exact details of the research, see the
